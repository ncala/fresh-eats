I used HMTL and SCSS to create this website. There are also javascript files running in the background that are from the original master, they are not mine. I have commented out a javascript section that I am attempting to learn. 

The FreshEats project is not complete because I got ahead of myself trying to add a slider. I have the html skeleton, some CSS, and some media queries complete but still need more time to complete styling, all media queries, add illustrations to the How it Worx section and create a grid for the Menus section. I also need to change the flow of the CSS coding to match industry standards. I estimate that I will have this done by the end of September at the absolute latest.
